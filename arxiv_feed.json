The proposed system features real-time sound analysis, automated classification of heart sounds, wireless connectivity for remote consultations, and an intuitive user interface accessible via smartphone integration. The design process employed a methodical approach incorporating customer feedback, competitive benchmarking, and systematic concept generation and selection. Through a structured evaluation framework, we analyzed portability, frequency response sensitivity, transmission quality, maintenance ease, user interface simplicity, output signal quality, power efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The final design prioritizes biocompatibility, reliability, and cost-effectiveness while addressing the growing demand for telemedicine capabilities in cardiovascular care. The project emphasizes the transition from conventional design to advanced digital solutions while maintaining a focus on practical clinical applications. Each concept was modelled using SOLIDWORKS software, enabling detailed visualization and engineering analysis.

They have been used to prove tight lower bounds for several fundamental questions, especially in the ``low accuracy'' regime. Unlike reconstruction/discrepancy approaches however, they are more suited for query sets that arise naturally from the fingerprinting codes construction.

Moreover, it may not adequately address the dynamic nature of artistic styles and the rapidly evolving landscape of digital art. We present a novel, training-free framework to solve the style attribution problem, using the features produced by a diffusion model alone, without any external modules or retraining. This is denoted as introspective style attribution (IntroStyle) and demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art models for style retrieval.

In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask.

In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask.

In contrast, training on Japanese text could improve question-answering tasks about Japanese knowledge and English-Japanese translation, which indicates that abilities for solving these two tasks can be regarded as \\textit{Japanese abilities} for LLMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Japanese abilities scale with the computational budget for Japanese text."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.14471v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CL", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Koshiro Saito, Sakae Mizuki, Masanari Ohi, Taishi Nakamura, Taihei Shiotani, Koki Maeda, Youmi Ma, Kakeru Hattori, Kazuki Fujii, Takumi Okamoto, Shigeki Ishida, Hiroya Takamura, Rio Yokota, Naoaki Okazaki"}], "author": "Koshiro Saito, Sakae Mizuki, Masanari Ohi, Taishi Nakamura, Taihei Shiotani, Koki Maeda, Youmi Ma, Kakeru Hattori, Kazuki Fujii, Takumi Okamoto, Shigeki Ishida, Hiroya Takamura, Rio Yokota, Naoaki Okazaki", "author_detail": {"name": "Koshiro Saito, Sakae Mizuki, Masanari Ohi, Taishi Nakamura, Taihei Shiotani, Koki Maeda, Youmi Ma, Kakeru Hattori, Kazuki Fujii, Takumi Okamoto, Shigeki Ishida, Hiroya Takamura, Rio Yokota, Naoaki Okazaki"}}, {"title": "Promptable Representation Distribution Learning and Data Augmentation for Gigapixel Histopathology WSI Analysis", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "Promptable Representation Distribution Learning and Data Augmentation for Gigapixel Histopathology WSI Analysis"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14473"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14473", "summary": "arXiv:2412.14473v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gigapixel image analysis, particularly for whole slide images (WSIs), often relies on multiple instance learning (MIL).

Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%.

We show that substantial improvement in alignment with the given preferences can be achieved simply by calibrating the implicit reward to ensure that the learned implicit rewards are comparable in scale to the ground-truth rewards. We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of Cal-DPO over existing approaches. The results of our experiments on a variety of standard benchmarks show that Cal-DPO remarkably improves off-the-shelf methods."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.14516v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.CL", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Teng Xiao, Yige Yuan, Huaisheng Zhu, Mingxiao Li, Vasant G Honavar"}], "author": "Teng Xiao, Yige Yuan, Huaisheng Zhu, Mingxiao Li, Vasant G Honavar", "author_detail": {"name": "Teng Xiao, Yige Yuan, Huaisheng Zhu, Mingxiao Li, Vasant G Honavar"}}, {"title": "Efficient Self-Supervised Video Hashing with Selective State Spaces", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "Efficient Self-Supervised Video Hashing with Selective State Spaces"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14518"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14518", "summary": "arXiv:2412.14518v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Self-supervised video hashing (SSVH) is a practical task in video indexing and retrieval.

In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions.

MixLLM identifies the output features with high salience in the global view rather than within each single layer, effectively assigning the larger bit-width to output features that need it most to achieve good accuracy with low memory consumption. We present the sweet spot of quantization configuration of algorithm-system co-design that leads to high accuracy and system efficiency. To address the system challenge, we design the two-step dequantization to make use of the int8 Tensor Core easily and fast data type conversion to reduce dequantization overhead significantly, and present the software pipeline to overlap the memory access, dequantization and the MatMul to the best. Extensive experiments show that with only 10% more bits, the PPL increasement can be reduced from about 0.5 in SOTA to within 0.2 for Llama 3.1 70B, while on average MMLU-Pro improves by 0.93 over the SOTA of three popular models. In addition to its superior accuracy, MixLLM also achieves state-of-the-art system efficiency."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.14590v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Zhen Zheng, Xiaonan Song, Chuanjie Liu"}], "author": "Zhen Zheng, Xiaonan Song, Chuanjie Liu", "author_detail": {"name": "Zhen Zheng, Xiaonan Song, Chuanjie Liu"}}, {"title": "Multi-Sensor Object Anomaly Detection: Unifying Appearance, Geometry, and Internal Properties", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "Multi-Sensor Object Anomaly Detection: Unifying Appearance, Geometry, and Internal Properties"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14592"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14592", "summary": "arXiv:2412.14592v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Object anomaly detection is essential for industrial quality inspection, yet traditional single-sensor methods face critical limitations.

To address these challenges, a common approach is to transform the precipitation variable nonlinearly into one that is more malleable. In this work, we explore how deep learning can be used to generate a smooth, spatio-temporally continuous variable as a proxy for simulation of precipitation data. We develop a normally distributed field called pseudo-precipitation (PP) as an alternative for simulating precipitation.

Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time.

Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms.

In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.14758v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.LO", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "math.LO", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "arxiv_journal_reference": "Topoi 2024, Special issue 'Meaning and Understanding via Proofs'", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander V.

We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), a novel approach designed to address the agent-temporal credit assignment problem by redistributing sparse rewards both temporally and across agents. TAR$^2$ decomposes sparse global rewards into time-step-specific rewards and calculates agent-specific contributions to these rewards.

Such an algorithm cuts the input string into chunks, independently recognizes each chunk in parallel by means of identical FAs, and at last joins the chunk results and checks overall consistency.

To overcome this limitation, recently introduced skeleton action segmentation models involve un-trimmed skeleton videos into end-to-end training. The model is optimized to provide frame-wise predictions for any length of testing videos, simultaneously realizing action localization and classification. Yet, achieving such an improvement im-poses frame-wise annotated skeleton videos, which remains time-consuming in practice. This paper features a novel framework for skeleton-based action segmentation trained on short trimmed skeleton videos, but that can run on longer un-trimmed videos. The approach is implemented in three steps: Stitch, Contrast, and Segment.

To overcome this limitation, recently introduced skeleton action segmentation models involve un-trimmed skeleton videos into end-to-end training. The model is optimized to provide frame-wise predictions for any length of testing videos, simultaneously realizing action localization and classification. Yet, achieving such an improvement im-poses frame-wise annotated skeleton videos, which remains time-consuming in practice. This paper features a novel framework for skeleton-based action segmentation trained on short trimmed skeleton videos, but that can run on longer un-trimmed videos. The approach is implemented in three steps: Stitch, Contrast, and Segment. First, Stitch proposes a tem-poral skeleton stitching scheme that treats trimmed skeleton videos as elementary human motions that compose a semantic space and can be sampled to generate multi-action stitched se-quences. Contrast learns contrastive representations from stitched sequences with a novel discrimination pretext task that enables a skeleton encoder to learn meaningful action-temporal contexts to improve action segmentation.

However, our work also shows how, to be useful and usable, AI for supporting privacy decision-making must account for posting context, disclosure norms, and users' lived threat models, and provide explanations that help contextualize detected risks."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.15047v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.HC", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.AI", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Isadora Krsek, Anubha Kabra, Yao Dou, Tarek Naous, Laura A.

Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts. However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce.\n  An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain.

Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts. However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce.\n  An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain.

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available.

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available.

Experimental results show that our SAAP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving 2.17%, 2.37%, and 2.39% accuracy gains on LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B.

To address this, we propose a transferable framework that reduces the data bottleneck by using a unified digital human model as a common prototype and bypassing the need for re-training on every new robot platform. The model learns behavior primitives from human demonstrations through adversarial imitation, and the complex robot structures are decomposed into functional components, each trained independently and dynamically coordinated. Task generalization is achieved through a human-object interaction graph, and skills are transferred to different robots via embodiment-specific kinematic motion retargeting and dynamic fine-tuning. Our framework is validated on five humanoid robots with diverse configurations, demonstrating stable loco-manipulation and highlighting its effectiveness in reducing data requirements and increasing the efficiency of skill transfer across platforms."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.15166v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.RO", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.AI", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Junjia Liu, Zhuo Li, Minghao Yu, Zhipeng Dong, Sylvain Calinon, Darwin Caldwell, Fei Chen"}], "author": "Junjia Liu, Zhuo Li, Minghao Yu, Zhipeng Dong, Sylvain Calinon, Darwin Caldwell, Fei Chen", "author_detail": {"name": "Junjia Liu, Zhuo Li, Minghao Yu, Zhipeng Dong, Sylvain Calinon, Darwin Caldwell, Fei Chen"}}, {"title": "SqueezeMe: Efficient Gaussian Avatars for VR", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "SqueezeMe: Efficient Gaussian Avatars for VR"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15171"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15171", "summary": "arXiv:2412.15171v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gaussian Splatting has enabled real-time 3D human avatars with unprecedented levels of visual quality.

Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360{\\deg} synthesis."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.15185v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CV", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Or Madar, Ohad Fried"}], "author": "Or Madar, Ohad Fried", "author_detail": {"name": "Or Madar, Ohad Fried"}}, {"title": "LlamaFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "LlamaFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188", "summary": "arXiv:2412.15188v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present LlamaFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences.

A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from certain probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads.\n  In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input.\n  On the positive side, we identify classes of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning.

A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from certain probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads.\n  In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input.\n  On the positive side, we identify classes of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in these classes spectral bisection with the _normalized_ Laplacian outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices.

Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs, or the class of the planar graphs, or the class of the graphs whose degree is bounded by a value $d>k$. In all cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\\frac{5n}{13}>0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)<0.572n+O(1)$ vertices."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.14784v1", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "math.CO", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.DM", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Marco D'Elia, Fabrizio Frati"}], "author": "Marco D'Elia, Fabrizio Frati", "author_detail": {"name": "Marco D'Elia, Fabrizio Frati"}}, {"title": "Asymptotically Enumerating Independent Sets in Regular $k$-Partite $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "Asymptotically Enumerating Independent Sets in Regular $k$-Partite $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14845"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14845", "summary": "arXiv:2412.14845v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The number of independent sets in regular bipartite expander graphs can be efficiently approximated by expressing it as the partition function of a suitable polymer model and truncating its cluster expansion.

To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid.

Efficiently computing an LDD has heretofore only been known for undirected graphs in both the parallel and distributed models."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2303.00811v2", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.DC", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.DS", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Vikrant Ashvinkumar, Aaron Bernstein, Nairen Cao, Christoph Grunau, Bernhard Haeupler, Yonggang Jiang, Danupon Nanongkai, Hsin Hao Su"}], "author": "Vikrant Ashvinkumar, Aaron Bernstein, Nairen Cao, Christoph Grunau, Bernhard Haeupler, Yonggang Jiang, Danupon Nanongkai, Hsin Hao Su", "author_detail": {"name": "Vikrant Ashvinkumar, Aaron Bernstein, Nairen Cao, Christoph Grunau, Bernhard Haeupler, Yonggang Jiang, Danupon Nanongkai, Hsin Hao Su"}}, {"title": "SCB-dataset: A Dataset for Detecting Student Classroom Behavior", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "SCB-dataset: A Dataset for Detecting Student Classroom Behavior"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02488"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02488", "summary": "arXiv:2304.02488v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The use of deep learning methods for automatic detection of students' classroom behavior is a promising approach to analyze their class performance and enhance teaching effectiveness.

The findings demonstrate that designer interactions lead to a more focused solution space, resulting in improved architectural quality. By directing the search towards regions of interest, the interaction uncovers architectures that remain unexplored in the fully automated process.

In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data. Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical.

In federated learning, a central server periodically coordinates models with clients and aggregates the models trained locally by clients without necessitating access to local data. Despite its potential, the implementation of federated learning continues to encounter several challenges, predominantly the slow convergence that is largely due to data heterogeneity. The slow convergence becomes particularly problematic in cross-device federated learning scenarios where clients may be strongly limited by computing power and storage space, and hence counteracting methods that induce additional computation or memory cost on the client side such as auxiliary objective terms and larger training iterations can be impractical.

A cherry-picking model is a model that makes mistakes on purpose, selecting bad individuals from a minority class instead of better candidates from the same minority. The model literally cherry-picks whom to select to superficially meet the fairness constraints while making minimal changes to the unfair model. This practice has been described as \"blatantly unfair\" and has a negative impact on already marginalized communities, undermining the intended purpose of fairness measures specifically designed to protect these communities. A common assumption is that cherry-picking arises solely from malicious intent and that models designed only to optimize fairness metrics would avoid this behavior. We show that this is not the case: models optimized to minimize fairness metrics while maximizing performance are often forced to cherry-pick to some degree. In other words, cherry-picking might be an inevitable outcome of the optimization process itself.

A cherry-picking model is a model that makes mistakes on purpose, selecting bad individuals from a minority class instead of better candidates from the same minority. The model literally cherry-picks whom to select to superficially meet the fairness constraints while making minimal changes to the unfair model. This practice has been described as \"blatantly unfair\" and has a negative impact on already marginalized communities, undermining the intended purpose of fairness measures specifically designed to protect these communities. A common assumption is that cherry-picking arises solely from malicious intent and that models designed only to optimize fairness metrics would avoid this behavior. We show that this is not the case: models optimized to minimize fairness metrics while maximizing performance are often forced to cherry-pick to some degree. In other words, cherry-picking might be an inevitable outcome of the optimization process itself.

Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark.

We generalize the concept of stable rank to the p-stable in any Schatten p-norm, thereby unifying the concepts of stable rank and intrinsic dimension: The stable rank is the 2-stable rank, while the intrinsic dimension is the 1-stable rank of a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix. We derive sum and product inequalities for the pth root of the p-stable rank, and show that it is well-conditioned in the norm-wise absolute sense. The conditioning improves if the matrix and the perturbation are Hermitian positive semi-definite."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2407.21594v2", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "math.NA", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.NA", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Ilse C.

However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning.

However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning.

However, as generative AI relying on massive text corpora becomes increasingly valuable, platforms have greatly restricted access to data through official channels. As a result, researchers will likely engage in more web scraping to collect data, introducing new challenges and concerns for researchers. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for web scraping in social science research for U.S.-based researchers, examining the legal, ethical, institutional, and scientific factors that researchers should consider when scraping the web.

However, as generative AI relying on massive text corpora becomes increasingly valuable, platforms have greatly restricted access to data through official channels. As a result, researchers will likely engage in more web scraping to collect data, introducing new challenges and concerns for researchers. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for web scraping in social science research for U.S.-based researchers, examining the legal, ethical, institutional, and scientific factors that researchers should consider when scraping the web.

We assess the abilities of such reinforcement learning agents to transfer between different tasks. We perform our evaluation using the Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark, and consider the efficacy of the transferred agents, as well as how quickly they can be trained. We find that pretraining an agent on one task benefits the performance of the agent in another task in all but 1 task when considering final performance.

Experiments with RAGONITE on ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves RAG performance, and counterfactual attribution is effective at explaining RAG answers."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2412.10571v2", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "cs.CL", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.IR", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Chris Hinze, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech"}], "author": "Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Chris Hinze, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech", "author_detail": {"name": "Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Chris Hinze, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech"}}, {"title": "One Pixel is All I Need", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "One Pixel is All I Need"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10681"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10681", "summary": "arXiv:2412.10681v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved record-breaking performance in various visual tasks.

This work focuses on monocular RGB VO where the input is a monocular RGB video without IMU or 3D sensors. Existing approaches lack robustness under this challenging scenario and fail to generalize to unseen data (especially outdoors); they also cannot recover metric-scale poses. We propose Robust Metric Visual Odometry (RoMeO), a novel method that resolves these issues leveraging priors from pre-trained depth models. RoMeO incorporates both monocular metric depth and multi-view stereo (MVS) models to recover metric-scale, simplify correspondence search, provide better initialization and regularize optimization.

This work focuses on monocular RGB VO where the input is a monocular RGB video without IMU or 3D sensors. Existing approaches lack robustness under this challenging scenario and fail to generalize to unseen data (especially outdoors); they also cannot recover metric-scale poses. We propose Robust Metric Visual Odometry (RoMeO), a novel method that resolves these issues leveraging priors from pre-trained depth models. RoMeO incorporates both monocular metric depth and multi-view stereo (MVS) models to recover metric-scale, simplify correspondence search, provide better initialization and regularize optimization.

Teacher discourse, significantly influencing student performance, is a key component. However, coding this discourse can be laborious. This study addresses this issue by introducing a new methodology for optimising the assessment of teacher discourse. The research consisted of two studies, both within the framework of engaging messages used by secondary education teachers. The first study involved training two large language models on real-world examples from audio-recorded lessons over two academic years to identify and classify the engaging messages from the lessons' transcripts. This resulted in sensitivities of 84.31% and 91.11%, and specificities of 97.69% and 86.36% in identification and classification, respectively. The second study applied these models to transcripts of audio-recorded lessons from a third academic year to examine the frequency and distribution of message types by educational level and moment of the academic year.

Teacher discourse, significantly influencing student performance, is a key component. However, coding this discourse can be laborious. This study addresses this issue by introducing a new methodology for optimising the assessment of teacher discourse. The research consisted of two studies, both within the framework of engaging messages used by secondary education teachers. The first study involved training two large language models on real-world examples from audio-recorded lessons over two academic years to identify and classify the engaging messages from the lessons' transcripts. This resulted in sensitivities of 84.31% and 91.11%, and specificities of 97.69% and 86.36% in identification and classification, respectively. The second study applied these models to transcripts of audio-recorded lessons from a third academic year to examine the frequency and distribution of message types by educational level and moment of the academic year. Results showed teachers predominantly use messages emphasising engagement benefits, linked to improved outcomes, while one-third highlighted non-engagement disadvantages, associated with increased anxiety.

Exploiting the sparsity pattern of the relaxations, we decompose the problems and obtain equivalent relaxations in a much smaller cone, making the conic approaches scalable. To make the best usage of the decomposed relaxations, we propose heuristics using the information of its optimal solution. Moreover, an exact procedure is proposed by solving a sequence of mixed-integer decomposed semidefinite optimization problems.

As a key step, we provide a detailed characterization of the trajectory and interactions of low-dimensional projections that capture the high-dimensional dynamics."}, "id": "oai:arXiv.org:2408.06401v2", "guidislink": false, "tags": [{"term": "stat.ML", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "cs.LG", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "math.PR", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "math.ST", "scheme": null, "label": null}, {"term": "stat.TH", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2024, 12, 20, 5, 0, 0, 4, 355, 0], "arxiv_announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}, "authors": [{"name": "G\\'erard Ben Arous, C\\'edric Gerbelot, Vanessa Piccolo"}], "author": "G\\'erard Ben Arous, C\\'edric Gerbelot, Vanessa Piccolo", "author_detail": {"name": "G\\'erard Ben Arous, C\\'edric Gerbelot, Vanessa Piccolo"}}, {"title": "OCTCube-M: A 3D multimodal optical coherence tomography foundation model for retinal and systemic diseases with cross-cohort and cross-device validation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cs", "value": "OCTCube-M: A 3D multimodal optical coherence tomography foundation model for retinal and systemic diseases with cross-cohort and cross-device validation"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11227"}], "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11227", "summary": "arXiv:2408.11227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We present OCTCube-M, a 3D OCT-based multi-modal foundation model for jointly analyzing OCT and en face images.
